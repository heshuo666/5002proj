Because we have too many labels, so we save the middle results in the process.
If you want to reproduce the result, please put the original data in data-sets/KDD-Cup/data.
Sorry for that, because we have more than 15 models...
And you need to firstly run FFT, MP, RRCF, SW, SR, VMD.
Sorry to bother but we do not have other methods...
